## JustOneThing
Work on one thing at a time without needing to face your entire todo list if you don't want to. 

### The Main Interface
The goal of JustOneThing is to avoid overloading you or making you think of everything you need to get done. No list is displayed unless you seek it out. If your list is empty, you'll only have an option to add a task. If not, you can choose to start a task, at which point you'll be assigned a random one.

### Adding Tasks
Every task you add contains four elements:
* **What it is**: A brief description of the task
* **Why it's important**: Why is it important to get this done? You'll see this reason when the task is assigned to you.
* **What you will need**: Any phone numbes, email addresses, or anything else you'll want to have handy when you're doing this task.
* **How hard it is**: This can reflect the physical difficulty, complexity, or emotional or time drain of the task. Don't think too much about it.

### Working on a Task
When you "start one thing," a random task will be selected for you. You can choose to accept it or reject it. In the future, rejecting the task will impact your ability to maintain a streak. If you choose to accept at ask, a notification will be schedueled for one hour or the interval you've set in the settings. From the notification, you can indicate that you've completed the task, or you can snooze the alert.

### Viewing All Your Tasks
If you need to see and manage all of the tasks you've created, you can do so from the toolbar. From this interface, you can mark tasks complete or delete them.
